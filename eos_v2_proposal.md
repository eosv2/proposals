### **Proposal** 
Change from Current [EOS Interim Constitution v1](https://github.com/EOS-Mainnet/governance/blob/master/eosio.system/eosio.system-clause-constitution-rc.md) to EOS [Constitution v2 (Block One Developers proposal)](https://block.one/news/block-ones-proposal-for-eos-constitution-v2-0/) 

EOS Constitution v2.0

Article 1 - Intent of code
If there is a dispute on intent of code, then intent shall be determined by a super majority vote of elected producers or an arbiter mutually agreed to by the parties to the dispute and enacted by producers. A super majority may, at their discretion, freeze a contract during an active dispute until such time as code to fix the contract is available. The parties to the dispute must produce proposed replacement code. The producers may charge a reasonable fee and/or place other reasonable requirements on the parties to the dispute. A super majority is defined as 2/3+1. Ricardian contractual terms that cannot be enforced by properly functioning code are beyond the scope of the producers authority to evaluate and enforce.

Article 2 - Freezing
Block producers shall not freeze or modify contracts that are operating as intended.

Article 3 - Bugs
Contract developers are not liable for damages caused by unintentional bugs in the code. All Parties are responsible for auditing the code and the Ricardian contract before use.

Article 4 - Ricardian
All service providers who produce tools to facilitate the construction and signing of transactions on behalf of others shall present the full Ricardian Contract terms of this Constitution and other referenced contracts.

Article 5 - No Fiduciary
No Party shall have a fiduciary responsibility to support the value of the EOS token. The Parties do not authorize anyone to hold assets, borrow, speak, nor contract on behalf of EOS token holders or the blockchain collectively. This blockchain shall have no owners, managers, or fiduciaries.

Article 6 - Acceptance
A Ricardian Contract is deemed accepted when a transaction based on that contract is incorporated into the blockchain.

Article 7 - Consent
Parties voluntarily consent for all other Parties to permanently and irrevocably retain, copy, analyze, and distribute all broadcast transactions and derivative information.

Article 8 - Terms
Use of the blockchain shall constitute consent to its terms.

Article 9 - Dispute Resolution
This Constitution may be amended by a vote of the EOS token holders that attracts no less than 15% staked vote participation among tokens and no fewer than 10% more Yes votes than No votes, sustained for 30 continuous days within a 120 day period.
